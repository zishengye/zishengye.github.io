    <h1>For a future of automation.</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi I am Zisheng Ye, a first year PhD student at Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of
        Wisconsin-Madison. Now, I am
        working with <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/Faculty/Pan_Wenxiao/">Prof.
            Wenxiao Pan</a>
        on modeling and optimization of biomimetic nanomaterials. Prior to join <a
            href="https://pan.labs.wisc.edu/">Pan's Lab</a>, I was a master student
        work in the <a href="http://sml.me.cmu.edu/">Soft Machines Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon Univesrity under the
        supervision of <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/majidi-carmel.html">Prof. Carmel
            Majidi</a> on
        designing and optimization soft robots. I got my bachelor degree in Engineering Mechanics from Beijing Institute
        of Technology, China. There, I helped the design and implementation of a parallel programme to do the simulation
        of large-scale flexible multi-body dynamic systems. </p>
